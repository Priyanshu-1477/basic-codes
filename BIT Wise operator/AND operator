1. C++ Bitwise AND Operator

The bitwise AND & operator returns 1 if and only if both the operands are 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

The following table demonstrates the working of the bitwise AND operator. Let a and b be two operands that can only take binary values i.e. 1 and 0.

a	    b	    a & b
0	    0	      0
0	    1	      0
1	    0	      0
1	    1	      1
Note: The table above is known as the "Truth Table" for the bitwise AND operator.

Let's take a look at the bitwise AND operation of two integers 12 and 25:

12 = 00001100 (In Binary)

25 = 00011001 (In Binary)

//Bitwise AND Operation of 12 and 25

     00001100
&    00011001
     _________
     00001000  = 8 (In decimal)


Example 1: Bitwise AND


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // declare variables
    int a = 12, b = 25;

    cout << "a = " << a << endl;
    cout << "b = " << b << endl;
    cout << "a & b = " << (a & b) << endl;

    return 0;
}
Run Code
Output

a = 12
b = 25
a & b = 8

In the above example, we have declared two variables a and b. Here, notice the line,

cout << "a & b = " << (a & b) << endl;
Here, we are performing bitwise AND between variables a and b.
