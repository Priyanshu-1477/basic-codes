2. C++ Bitwise OR Operator

The bitwise OR | operator returns 1 if at least one of the operands is 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

The following truth table demonstrates the working of the bitwise OR operator. Let a and b be two operands that can only take binary values i.e. 1 or 0.

a  	  b	    a | b
0	    0	      0
0	    1	      1
1	    0	      1
1	    1    	  1

Let us look at the bitwise OR operation of two integers 12 and 25:

12 = 00001100 (In Binary)
25 = 00011001 (In Binary)

Bitwise OR Operation of 12 and 25
    00001100
|   00011001
    _________
    00011101  = 29 (In decimal)
Example 2: Bitwise OR
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a = 12, b = 25;

    cout << "a = " << a << endl;
    cout << "b = " << b << endl;
    cout << "a | b = " << (a | b) << endl;

    return 0;
}
Run Code
Output

a = 12
b = 25
a | b = 29

The bitwise OR of a = 12 and b = 25 gives 29.
